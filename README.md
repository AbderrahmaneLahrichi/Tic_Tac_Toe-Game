# Blackjack Game: User vs. Computer 

Here I created a basic blackjack game using a standard 52 card deck. The player has the option to hit, stand or even exit the game window.  I have created a shuffling function for the cards and the cards will be handed out randomly.

Basic Rules of the Game:
- Deal two cards to the Dealer and two cards to the Player.
- We will only show one card of the dealers and show both the players card.
- Ask the Player if they wish to Hit, and take another card.
- If the Player's hand doesn't Bust (go over 21), ask if they'd like to Hit again.
- If a Player Stands, play the Dealer's hand. The dealer will always Hit until the Dealer's value meets or exceeds 17
- Check the cards and see whether the Player or Dealer wins the game if the player wins.
- Askthe player if he wants to play again

# Future game updates:
I will be looking to  introduce betting into this game. Currently It is just a friendly game where peopel can and get familiar with how the game is supposed to be played. I plan to add a  range slide that will allow people to choose how many chips they want to bet then choose to deal.
